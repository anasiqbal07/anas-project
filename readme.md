A Live Lane-Line Detection Systems built-in Python language is another Data Science project. A human driver receives lane detecting instruction from lines placed on the road in this project. The lines placed on the roads indicate where the lanes are located for human driving. It also refers to the vehicleâ€™s steering direction. This application is crucial for the development of self-driving cars. This application for the Data Science Project is critical for the development of self-driving cars. By the help of python and openCV and using /import differentr libraries i have weritten a code which detects the road lane lines .
